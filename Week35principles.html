  <h1>5 Design Principles of ESPN</h1>
  <h2>Affordance<h2>

  <p>This picture exemplifies Affordance because of the arrows in the menu bar. As soon as a user opens the page, they realize that the arrows show that there are more things to view if you click them. The arrows play as the physical characteristics while they create the "slide over" function.

  <h2>Mapping</h2>

  <p>This picture exemplifies Mapping because this menu bar by its self shows that you can access different pages that can perform different task you want to carry out. Therefore there is different controls for different effects.

 <h2> Chuncking</h2>

 <p>
 This drop down menu showcases a large amount of information that is chucked together for the ease of the user to locate within the ESPN website.  </p>

  <h2>Hick's Law</h2>

  <p>
This section of the website exemplifies Hick's Law because it presents so many options for you to navigate to. The amount of time that it would take you to make a decision on the page would take longer because as you scroll up and down the page, more things will be discoverable to you.

  <h2>Rule of Thirds<h2>

  <p>The design is clearly broke up in three categories. On the far left, you see your "Favorites",the middle shows you the "News" column, and far left column shows "Social Media Update".
